In the holy city of Nashik resided Pol Baba, a sage whose name meant "empty." He had achieved a magnificent, radiant emptiness—a void free of worry, stress, and, as a testament to his sheer mastery, any appointments before noon.

Baba's mornings were a display of spiritual rigor, demonstrated not by him, but in "admiration" of his most senior human disciples, Brij and Yuktaa.

Yuktaa, a woman of profound stillness, was the exemplar of "The Perfect Joining." She demonstrated this demanding art by expertly joining her posterior to a velvet cushion, where she would remain, eyes closed, for hours. Baba, in a gesture of what he called profound spiritual "admiration" (which looked suspiciously like a middle-aged crush) for her "stillness," named his own sacred morning ritual the Yuktaasan: the holy act of scrolling through her Instagram stories with a sigh, while humming his favorite "bhajan," a nasal, droning rendition of the Hindi song Pol aa gayi Pol.

Then there was Brij, a man of serene horizontality. Brij had perfected the metaphysical 'bridge' spanning the arduous gap between one nap and the next. He was also, to Baba's eternal and poorly-concealed jealousy, a master of the Yuktaasan, often achieving a "stillness" far deeper than Baba's own, causing the sage to mutter about "disrespectful levels of pol." Furthermore, Brij was the sole master of the infamous Suraviaasan—the art of achieving a deep, rumbling, "spiritually resonant" snore while remaining bolt upright. (This asana was named in "distant admiration"—a pining he'd held onto since 1998—for an AOL acquaintance of Baba's named Suravi, who, he claimed, "held a profound vibration" and had clearly left him on 'read'). His form was so "transcendent" that the untrained often mistook it for a deep coma, only with advanced audio features.

This state of "transcendence" was often aided by the presence of Vinisha. Vinisha was a unique spiritual force, capable of producing "infinite sound"—an unending stream of absolute nonsense. She could "channel" for hours, weaving together topics from crystal healing, to the panauti status of the local cricket team, to her unending and "profound" (and loudly unrequited) romantic devotion to some man named Harshit, often without pausing for breath. While Pol Baba and Athu found her "vibrations" intensely irritating, Brij adored her company. He would lie there, eyes closed in his Suraviaasan, a beatific smile on his face as her nonsensical monologue provided the perfect "sonic blanket" for his nap. Baba often ridiculed this "sacred partnership," noting that Brij's "emptiness" was simply being filled with "a different, and much louder, kind of pol."

But even these "titans of tranquility" were mere amateurs, pale shadows compared to the ultimate grandmaster, the Sage Neev. Neev, or 'foundation', had laid the very bedrock of achieving true, weapon-grade inactivity. Pol Baba spoke of him with a breathless, tearful "reverence" usually reserved for deities or tax refunds. "Neev," Baba would whisper, "could achieve Vishram (Rest) while standing in a queue. He once achieved a three-day Brijraasan during a tax audit. We are but children playing in his shadow."

These were the exemplars. Then there was Athu. Athu, a sincere, sweaty young man, humbly massaged Baba's feet, wondering why his own attempts at "The Perfect Joining" just gave him cramps.

The final disciple, and (according to Baba) the most advanced, was Dhyaan. Dhyaan was a dolphin. "Dhyaan understands flow," Baba would patiently explain to Athu. "He is buoyant. Brij is horizontal. Yuktaa is seated. You, Athu, are... vertical and sweating. Be more buoyant. You're a panauti." Dhyaan resided in a marble tank, "chatting" with Freya the female dolphin, communicating profound Vedic insights via clicks and whistles, which Baba alone could translate. Miraculously, these insights often coincided with feeding time.

The ashram also housed other "seekers." There was Riyaansh, a taxi driver who ran the "Phat Phat Taxi Service" and was a master of "karmic chance." He would "spiritually transfer" funds from Pol Baba’s Shahi Paytm account directly into his Dream11 app, seeking enlightenment on player stats. The ashram's one moment of true crisis occurred when the Dream11 app was banned. Pol Baba became so enraged at this disruption of "karmic flow" that his disciples gasped, "BABA CRODHIT HO GAYE!" (Baba has become wrathful!). It was a miracle.

Then there was Jayesh Kapadia, the "dancing idiot." Jayesh would, uninvited, perform an "intimidating" Bhangra, full of aggressive shoulder-shaking and loud "Balle Balle!" shouts, which he claimed "cleared the negative energy" but which usually just made Baba spill his tea. Vinisha and Jayesh were once friends, as were Jayesh and Brij, but these sacred bonds dissolved after Jayesh was caught "badmouthing" them, proving that maya (illusion) was indeed everywhere.

There was Siddhartha, a man who could eat an infinite amount of food. Pol Baba was often annoyed by the grocery bills, but maintained a secret, deep, and slightly breathless "admiration" for Siddhartha's "all-consuming void," seeing it as a purer, more "manly" form of pol than his own.

And finally, there was the Jenish. Shrouded in mystery, this two-dimensional object, retrieved from the Shahi Nalla (Royal Drain) of Nashik, was kept on a velvet cloth. No one knew its purpose, but Baba insisted it held "potent flat-earth energy."

The spiritual peak of the week was the Tuesday Phat Phat Padyatra, or 'holy walk'. After Athu spent forty-five minutes preparing a thermos and tiffin (Brij and Yuktaa were, of course, "deep in practice"), the grueling nine-minute, four-hundred-step pilgrimage to the front gate would commence. Sometimes, when Baba had not achieved his weekly Vishram, the padyatra would become a 100-meter Yathra in his Maruti Omni. "Observe, Athu," Baba would puff on the return (which was slightly uphill). "The purpose of all exertion... is only to make the Vishram sweeter."

When the Nashik summers soared, Baba, being a truly "non-attached" sage, would retreat to his 3BHK rental in Powai, explaining that "enlightenment is difficult above 40 degrees Celsius."

But the true ritual was the evening, when Baba retired to his holy-of-holies: The Shahi Pol Kund, a kidney-shaped swimming pool with jacuzzi jets. As the sun set, Pol Baba would perform his legendary Pol Dance—a series of slow, minimal gestures resembling a lazy, aquatic Macarena. Finally, he would lower himself into the heated water, achieving his final daily merging: the 'self' (Baba) with the 'vast emptiness' (the Pol/Pool), performing his ultimate Brijaasan, in what he described as a "profound, near-romantic admiration" for Brij's horizontal mastery. Athu would stand poolside, fanning the mosquitoes. Dhyaan would leap, squeaking a perfect Om and soaking Athu. "See?" Pol Baba would murmur, floating contentedly. "Dhyaan has merged. Brij and Vinisha have... bridged. They are one with the Pol. You, Athu, are still... fanning."
